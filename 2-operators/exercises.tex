\section*{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that $A\bullet B$ is distributive and commutative, but non-associative.
\item Prove that $A\bullet (A\bullet A)=(A\bullet A)\bullet A$ and that 
for any natural number $n$, $A^{\bullet n}$ is well-defined (power-associative).

\item Prove that $[A,B]_+$ is distributive, $[A,A]=0$, but non-associative.

\item Prove that $//a,b,c/,d,e/=/a,\backslash d,b,c\backslash,e/=/a,b,/c,d,e//$.

\item For symmetric matrices $A$ and $B$, prove that $U_A(B)\defeq ABA$ is symmetric.
(This is the quadratic Jordan product).  Prove that $B\mapsto U_A(B)$ is linear.  What 
about $A\mapsto U_A(B)$?

\item Prove that $2\{A,B,C\}=U_{A+C}(B)-U_A(B)-U_C(B)$.

\item Let $A,B$ be square complex matrices where $A^*=\bar{A}^{\dagger}=A$ and 
$B^*=B$.  Show that $(i[A,B])^*=i[A,B]$.  This is what connects Jordan algebras 
with Lie algebras in quantum mechanics.
