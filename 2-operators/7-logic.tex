\section{Operators for reasoning}

It surprises me that for roughly 2222 years logic had to be argued 
in poetic terms called syllogisms.  
\begin{quote}
    All men are mortal.\\
    Socrates is a man;\\
    Therefore Socrates is mortal.
\end{quote}
Written in more sterile terms 
\begin{quote}
    If x is a man then x is mortal.\\
    Socrates is a man;\\
    Therefore Socrates is mortal.
\end{quote}
In other words,
\begin{gather}
    \tag{Modus Ponens}
    \begin{array}{rl}
        P &\Rightarrow Q\\
        P\\
    \hline 
        Q
    \end{array}
\end{gather}
This Socratic reasoning included other forms such as 
\begin{quote}
    Some men are kings.\\
    
\end{quote}



George Boole  thought 
this could be done with algebra instead.  Propositions $P,Q,R,\ldots$
would be assigned values of true $\top$ or false $\bot$. 
\begin{gather*}
    \begin{array}{|c|c|}
        \hline 
         & \neg \\
        \hline 
        \top & \bot \\
        \bot & \top\\
        \hline
    \end{array}
    \qquad
    \begin{array}{|c|cc|}
        \hline 
        \wedge & \top & \bot\\
        \hline 
        \top & \top & \bot \\
        \bot & \bot & \bot\\
        \hline
    \end{array}
    \qquad 
    \begin{array}{|c|cc|}
        \hline 
        \vee & \top & \bot\\
        \hline 
        \top & \top & \top \\
        \bot & \top & \bot\\
        \hline
    \end{array}
    \qquad
    \begin{array}{|c|cc|}
        \hline 
        \Rightarrow & \top & \bot\\
        \hline 
        \top & \top & \bot \\
        \bot & \top & \top\\
        \hline
    \end{array}
\end{gather*}
The algebra was so simple that it rendered reasoning 
into computation and computer age followed.
