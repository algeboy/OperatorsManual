\chapter{Natural numbers as grammar}
\index{natural numbers|(}
Math in early history (early childhood) is counting.  Count 
pebbles or beads and give the patterns names
\begin{center}
    $0\defeq$ \underline{\hspace{5mm}}, 
    $1\defeq$ \StrokeOne,
    $2\defeq$ \StrokeTwo,
    $3\defeq$ \StrokeThree,
    $4\defeq$ \StrokeFour,
    $5\defeq$ \StrokeFive,...
\end{center}
One hypothesis for the symbol
``0'' is that it looks like the shape left by removing the last pebble from
a sand table leaving behind no pebbles.  Is this writing or is this math?
