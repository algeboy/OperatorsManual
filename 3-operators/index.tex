\section*{Conclusion}
A number of subtle problems are 
mounting.  For example, we probably want a Boolean (true/false) to 
go in the the left-most spot of an if-then-else-, and we cannot compose 
just any two functions and get expected results.  We scale a vector on one side 
by not the other.  Grammar must be more than just $\Box\cdot \Box$.
