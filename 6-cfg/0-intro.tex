The linguist Chompsky sparked a revolution in the study of language by detailing
grammar in a mathematical context.  To make a grammar there is one forgoing
assumption that we can take an alphabet of fixed symbols, traditionally denoted
$\Sigma$, and from that have some concept of words over that alphabet.  For
example $\Sigma\defeq\{a,b\}$ would mean that $aabaaabb$ is a string of type
$\Sigma^*$, the $*$ is known as the \emph{Kleene star},\index{Kleene star}.  We
write $aabaaabb:\Sigma^*$.  For convenience we let $\epsilon$ denote the empty
string.  More on this in a moment.
