\subsection{The operators for counting}
With Peano's grammar, or rather the history of tally counting, we have 
built our first fully formed algebra.  An algebra as we will come to formalize 
consists of something to be its numbers, in our case the natural numbers, i.e. tallies;
and operators.  The operators in this case or the two options.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The $0$ operator converts nothing into a starting point.  
    \item The successor operator \code{S<Nat>}, abbreviated now to just 
    $S\Box$, converts a given natural number into a new one.
\end{enumerate}
