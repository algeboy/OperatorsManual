\chapter{What is algebra?}

Algebra is the study of equations, for the most part equations involving variables.
That is because applications have unknowns and if the
the shape of the equation can tell us anything about the 
options to solve it we shall want to take advantage of this.
Witness how we divide $ax^2+bx+c=0$ into solutions that are 
real or complex based on $b^2-4ac\geq 0$.  

You probably already know every color, shape, and pattern of 
equation you will ever need.  Compare these two equations
\begin{align*}
    x^2+y^2 & \equiv 0 \pmod{541} 
    & 
    \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} & =0.
\end{align*}
These equations concern entirely unrelated context, for example $0$ on the right 
is a whole number, whereas 0 on the left is the function $0(x,y)=0.0$
Yet, the similarities as equations shine through.  This is because $0$, $1$, $+$,
and  powers of $2$ are abstractions.  The similarities we are observe are 
an exploration of a single equation
\[
    x^2+y^2=0.
\]
In fact, even the equality was an abstraction which could vary from context to context.
With such flexibility a small number of symbols and their grammar are enough to capture 
the huge variety of equations we encounter in real life.

Now since every symbol in an equation is a variable we have new powers 
to solve equations.  Look to the humble 
\[
    x^2+1=0.
\]
By our own view, right now this is nothing but variables, so it means nothing to
solve this.  But, drop this into a context such as decimal numbers $\mathbb{R}$
and the understanding is to replace $1\defeq 1.0$, $0\defeq 0.0$, $+$ is
substituted for addition of decimals, and square is by multiplying decimals.
Equality now means two equal decimals, or in practice two decimal numbers that are close enough 
to be considered equal.  The only remaining unknown is $x$, but as everyone 
knows, we wont find a solution as no square decimal is -1.

The power of variable everything is that we are not stuck with the real numbers.
Lets replace everything with complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$. Substitute $0\defeq
0+0i$, $1=1+0i$, $(a+bi)+(c+di)\defeq (a+b)+(c+d)i$, and
$(a+bi)^2=(a^2-b^2)+2abi$.  Now we find $\pm i$ are the solutions. Solutions do
exist!  Why stop here? Try quaternions, or $(2\times 2)$-matrices.  These each
have addition, 0, 1, and squares.  Now we learn there can be infinitely many
solutions to that equation.  This is the method of algebra: find all the values 
that can be substituted into an equation to see what makes solutions possible and 
how they behave.  Learn enough by this process and we can begin to predict 
if solutions are to be expected and fathom algorithms to find them when they do exist.
When the solutions become infinite we find ways to parameterize them with smaller 
data such a basis.

Don't forget equality is variable too!  Suppose we wanted to solve $x^{541}+x+1=0$
using only integers.  Replace equality 
with $\equiv$ modulo 2 and ask for a whole number $x$ that solves
\begin{align*}
    x^{541}+x+1\equiv 0\pmod{2}.
\end{align*}
All integers in this equality become either $0$ or $1$, but neither will solve 
this equation.  By varying equality we confirm there are no solutions.
