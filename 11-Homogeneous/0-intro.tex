Its past time to look at some algebras you likely already know.
Perhaps these are the algebras that got you into math.  These 
are things like groups and rings.  You can learn about these from 
just about anywhere but this ubiquity has some downsides.  
Often we take the unique aspects of these examples and project 
them as expectations onto algebra in general and come away with 
a stilted picture.  If this chapter does anything it wont be to 
get you more familiar with groups and rings, it will be to get you 
to realize you met them like uncles and aunts who gave you 
candy and birthday cards but you never really knew them.
