\chapter{Strings}
The point of basic patterns like those of Peano's Tally grammar is to use them
in more complex systems using the simpler pattern as a foundational
understanding of the resulting behavior. Imagine a string of characters in an
alphabet a, b,$\ldots$, z.  Well that is really just all the (lowercase) words
we could write including any gibberish like adfklakjfkl.  We will come to think
of this as an algebra because it has information that we modify through operations.
