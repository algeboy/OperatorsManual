\chapter{Formulas \& Equations}

Lets get precise about equations.  They have a left hand side and right hand side.
But the items that can occur on the left can also occur on the right so we could 
define any one side and be done.  The equations worth study are those involving 
variables, more precisely variable and operations since and equation $x\cdot y=1$ is 
infinitely more interesting than $x=1$.  So we start out with what are called 
formulas, but you would do well to think of these as generalized polynomials, 
only we might involve more operations than simply those found in common polynomials.
As a byproduct we will re-invent induction in a form that is used everywhere in 
in the design of software data types.
