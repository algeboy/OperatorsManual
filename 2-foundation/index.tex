\section*{Conclusion}

The process of replacing one set of symbols for another based on fixed rules 
is known in algebra circles as \emph{rewriting}\index{rewriting}.  Rewriting 
occurs everywhere from the evaluation of operators like we are explore now, 
to multiplying solvable groups, to solving algebraic geometry problems through 
Gr\"obner-Shirshov bases.  The strategies of rewriting evolve with every context 
but most have an arc similar to the one we pursue in this chapter.  Start by 
considering the order in which you rewrite.  Make it a partial order or at 
least a directed graph.  Search for confluence: places where branches meet back
together.  When enough confluence exists look for a reason for finite rewriting 
to reach a normal form---a unique lowest point, subject to the order we introduce.
Finally, when normal form exist the work begins to get that normal form efficiently.
Above all notice how many possible points of failure there are in effective 
rewriting.  As a general intuition treat rewriting as undecideable, but if decideable 
then exponentially hard, but if efficient then it was never rewriting---it was 
linear algebra in bad notation.
