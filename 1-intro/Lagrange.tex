 and how expanding a solution leads to symmetries (symmetric 
polynomials by today's verbage).
\begin{align*}
    \begin{array}{|c|cc|}
        \hline
        \times & x & -b \\
        \hline
        x & x^2 & {\color{blue} -bx}\\
        -a & {\color{blue} -ax} & {\color{red} ab} \\
    \hline
    \end{array}
    & \leadsto (x-a)(x-b)=x^2{\color{blue} -(a+b)x}{\color{red}+ab}
\end{align*}
We can flip the square along the diagonal like the transpose of a matrix 
and get the same product.  Thus a symmetry that moves the roots leave the 
resulting polynomial unchanged.  For cubics we get symmetries on a cube.

Lagrange witnessed a fluke.  You can gather the 4 roots as linear combinations
\begin{align*}
    s_{()} & = a+b+c+d\\
    s_{(12)(34)} & = a-b+c-d\\
    s_{(13)(24)} & = a-c+b-d\\
    s_{(14)(34)} & = a-d+c-b
\end{align*}
When solving a quartic, the term $s_{()}$ appears as the negative coefficient of 
$x^3$.  He then worked out how that because the remaining three are linear symmetric 
polynomials we can use them to write the other coefficients 
$(ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd)$, $(abc+abd+bcd)$, and $(abcd)$ as polynomials in 
the remaining $s$'s.  This means we have a single cubic polynomial which solves 
for the three missing numbers.  Having solved for all three $s$'s we use 
linear algebra to solve for the roots.
\begin{align*}
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
        1 & -1 & 1 & -1\\
        1 & 1 & -1 & -1\\
        1 & -1 & -1 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a\\ b\\ c\\ d 
    \end{bmatrix}
    & = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        s_{()}\\
        s_{(12)(34)}\\
        s_{(13)(24)}\\
        s_{(14)(32)}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
