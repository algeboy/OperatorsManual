\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find an infinite number of $(2\times 2)$-matrices $M$ 
    that are roots of the polynomial $x^2+1=0$.
    \item Find an infinite number of Hamiltonions $a+b\hat{i}+c\hat{\j}+d\hat{k}$
    that are roots of the polynomial $x^2+1=0$.
    \item Decide of $x^9+5x^4+10x+1$ has any integer roots by passing to a congruence modulo 
    2.
    \item Use the fact that $114^2-80^2\equiv 0 \pmod{1649}$ to find a proper prime 
    factor of $1649$.  

    \item A wave $w(t,x)$ in one dimension (e.g.\ a string) depends on time $t$ and position $x$.
    For example the middle $x=1/2$ of the string may be at rest at the start time $t=0$, so 
    $w(0,1/2)=0$.  At the start at position $x=0$ and $t=0$ the wave has raised the string up 
    one unit, so $w(0,0)=1$.  3 seconds later the wave passes the middle $x=1/2$,
    $w(1/2,3)=1$ and so on.  The wave equation is $\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2}-v^2\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2}=0$.
    Factor the difference of squares to get a product of first order separable differential equations 
    you can solve.
