Now that we have a language for algebra it is time to tell stories in algebra.
The first stories to tell in a society are ones that teach important truths.
For algebra no truth could more important that Noether's isomorphism theorems.
You may know it as the fundamental homommorphism theorem, a term that should 
have been the fundamental theorem of algebra.  But that term got assigned to 
something having essentially nothing to do with algebra.  The theorem itself is 
simple.  That is its power, it works its way into all of algebra because it has 
only the essential requirements.
