\section{Models interpreted in a language}

We know grammar lets us write down algebra and its formulas but so 
far we have built much of the algebra we see around us.  Formulas 
are not the stuff of numbers.  So the idea now is to evaluate the 
formulas on other data. The idea is to assign data types to a 
bunch of the tag names of the grammar and then use the production 
rules to identify the operations we need between the types.

So let us begin with a formal context-free grammar $\sigma$.
We assume its alphabet is $\Sigma$, its tag names are $N$, 
and its production rules are $P\subset N\times (\Sigma\sqcup N)^*$.
We will begin with the starting rules being $S=N$ and later remark on 
how to address the case when $S$ is a proper subset of $N$.

First we need to assign to every tag-name a type.  We can see this 
as a function.
\begin{align*}
    base:N\to \Type
\end{align*}
The person describing a model of the algebra is responsible for 
creating this assignment.  Next we need to extend this function 
to work on $N\sqcup \Sigma$ but in a some-what trivial manner 
meant mostly to name things not to demand new types.
\begin{align*}
    \overline{base}(x) & \defeq \begin{cases}
        base(n) & x=\iota_N(n)\\
        \{a\} & x=\iota_{\Sigma}(a)
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
Next we can extend $\overline{base}$ to apply to all 
strings of $(N\sqcup \Sigma)^*$ by replacing juxtaposition 
in the string with the cartesian product of types.  Doing so 
we now see how to align each production rule with an appropriate 
operator.  We assume 
our algebra comes with an assignment
\begin{align*}
    ops:\prod_{(A,w):P}\prod_{t\in w}\overline{base}(t)\to base(A).
\end{align*}

\begin{example}
    Fix the grammar \code{<<Nat>> ::= 0 | S <Nat>}.
    Then define 
    \begin{align*}
        base(Nat) & \defeq \mathbb{C}[x]\\
        ops_0 & : \{0\}\to \mathbb{C}[x] &  ops_0(0) & \defeq 1\\
        ops_S & : \{S\}\times \mathbb{C}[x]\to \mathbb{C}[x] &  ops_S(S,a(x)) & \defeq a(x)x.
    \end{align*}
    Thus $\{1,x,xx,\ldots, x^n,\ldots\}$ is interpretted in the language 
    of natural numbers.
\end{example}
