{\huge Answers...}
\begin{itemize}
      \item[$\Box$] What is an equation? A pair of formulas form the same unambiguous context-free grammar.
      \begin{itemize}
          \item[$\Box$] What is a context-free grammar? A model for expressing complex induction.
  
          \item[$\Box$] What is a variable? An element of the variable alphabet.
  
          \item[$\Box$] What makes an operator-variable? 
          A production rule in a context-free grammar set up as the signature of the formula.
  
          \item[$\Box$] What is a formula? A parse-tree of a context-free grammar with variables.

          
      %     \item[$\Box$] What is equality? (A variable with the Leibniz law as elimination.)
  
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
{\huge Questions...}
\begin{itemize}
      \item[$\Box$] What is an algebra? (A collection of types and operators matched to the 
      production rules of a context-free grammar.)
      \begin{itemize}
          \item[$\Box$] What substitutes for an operator in a formula? 
          (A $\lambda$ which can be typed to match the production rules of the grammar.)
  
          \item[$\Box$] What substitutes for a variable in a formula?
          (Terms of of the types matched to the grammar.)
          
          \item[$\Box$] What substitutes for equality in a formula? 
          (A congruence on the algebra.)
